  <h1 class="red">This is a first-level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
  <h2 class="blue">This is a second-level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
  <h3 class="green">This is a third-level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
  <p>This is a <em>paragraph</em>. As you can see, I placed an emphasis on the word "paragraph." Now, I will change the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color to green, all with just CSS.</p>
  <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
       <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
       <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript:</p>
    <p>First number: <span id="firstNum">15</span></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id="secondNum">9</span></p>
    <p>Therefore, the result is: <span id="answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
    <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Add">
    <input type="button" id="multiplyButton" value="Multiply">
    <input type="button" id="subtractButton" value="Subtract">
